 * For some GOG installers, some application files are shipped in GOG Galaxy format:
 * Thse files are split into one or more parts and then individually compressed.
 * The parts are decompressed and reassembled by pre-/post-install scripts.
 * This function parses the arguments to those scripts so that we can re-assemble them ourselves.
 *
 * The first part of a multi-part file has a before_install script that configures the output filename
 * as well as the number of parts in the file and a checksum for the whole file.
 *
 * Each part (including the first) has an after_install script with a checksum for the decompressed
 * part as well as compressed and decompressed sizes.
 *
 * Additionally, language constrained are also parsed from check scripts and added to the language list.
