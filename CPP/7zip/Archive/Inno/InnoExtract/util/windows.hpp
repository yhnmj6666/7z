 * Compatibility wrapper to work around deficiencies in Microsoft® Windows™.
 * Mostly deals with converting between UTF-8 and UTF-16 input/output.
 * More precisely:
 *  - Converts wide char command-line arguments to UTF-8 and calls utf8_main().
 *  - Sets an UTF-8 locale for boost::filesystem::path.
 *    This makes everything in boost::filesystem UTF-8 aware, except for {i,o,}fstream.
 *    For those, there are UTF-8 aware implementations in util/fstream.hpp
 *  - Converts UTF-8 to UTF-16 in std::cout and std::cerr if attached to a console
 *  - Interprets ANSI escape sequences in std::cout and std::cerr if attached to a console
 *  - Provides a Windows implementation of \ref isatty()
